 Dear Anita 
 
  While Executing this project in netbeans with cloudsim jar file added , 
  There are some bugs which are getting displayed . I tried to solve the issue but 
  still it is not working , some bugs are related to Maths functions (i added jar for math functions).

Following files are showing error

MyCloudletSchedulerDynamicWorkload.java
MyCloudletSchedulerSpaceShared.java
MyCloudletSchedulerTimeShared.java

PowerVm.java
PowerVmAllocationPolicyMigrationAbstractVmPlacementFFT.java
PowerVmSelectionPolicyMaximumCorrelation.java

would you like to solve it ?
or can you uplaod a New zip file of project (from Netbeans Folder) with all jar files which you have used .

Thank You 
Dinesh .
